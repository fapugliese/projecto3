Ohmyfood website

Ohmyfood is an online food ordering company. Our concept allows users to compose their
own menu and reduce waiting time in restaurants because they make their choice in
advance.

This repo houses the assets used to build the ohmyfood website, available at https://fapugliese.github.io/projecto3/.

CSS
The CSS for the site is built from Sass.
